# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technical Accuracy & Industry Alignment
Content must be technically accurate and reflect current industry practices in physical AI and humanoid robotics. All concepts, algorithms, and implementations should align with state-of-the-art research and commercial applications in the field.

### II. Beginner-to-Advanced Learning Flow
Structure content to guide readers from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations. Each chapter builds incrementally on previous knowledge, ensuring beginners can follow while providing depth for advanced readers.

### III. Hands-On, Project-Driven Learning
Every concept must be accompanied by practical, implementable projects. Readers learn by building real systems, implementing algorithms, and working with actual robotics platforms and simulation environments.

### IV. Open-Source Friendly Approach
All code examples, projects, and tools should leverage open-source technologies wherever possible. Promote community engagement through open-source robotics frameworks like ROS, Gazebo, PyBullet, and other accessible tools.

### V. Python & AI Foundation Assumption
Content assumes readers have Python programming skills and basic AI/machine learning knowledge. Build upon these foundations to introduce robotics-specific concepts without re-teaching basic programming or AI principles.

### VI. Accessible Hardware & Simulation Focus
Emphasize simulation environments and affordable hardware options to make content accessible. Prioritize tools that students can use without expensive robotics hardware, while providing paths to real hardware implementation.
