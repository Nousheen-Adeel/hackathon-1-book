# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book provides a hands-on, project-driven approach to understanding and implementing embodied intelligence in humanoid robotic systems.

## About This Book

This book is designed for students and practitioners with intermediate Python skills and basic AI knowledge who want to understand the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems. You'll learn how to build intelligent robots that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world.

## What You'll Learn

- Fundamentals of Robot Operating System (ROS 2)
- Robot modeling and simulation techniques
- Sensor integration and perception systems
- Motion planning and control algorithms
- Reinforcement learning for robotics
- Vision-language-action models (VLA)
- Human-robot interaction principles
- Multi-robot coordination and deployment

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:
- **Learning Goals**: What you'll understand by the end of the chapter
- **Key Technologies**: Tools and frameworks covered
- **Practical Outcomes**: Hands-on projects to implement
- **Code Samples**: Ready-to-run examples
- **Labs**: Step-by-step exercises

## Getting Started

Before diving into the content, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.8+
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- Gazebo simulation environment
- Basic knowledge of linear algebra and calculus
