### Part II: Perception and Understanding
- Sensor Integration and Data Processing
- Computer Vision for Robotics
- 3D Perception and Scene Understanding

### Part III: Motion and Control
- Kinematics and Dynamics
- Locomotion and Balance Control
- Motion Planning and Navigation

### Part IV: Intelligence and Learning
- Reinforcement Learning for Robotics
- Imitation Learning and VLA
- Human-Robot Interaction

### Part V: Integration and Applications
- Multi-Robot Systems and Coordination
- Real-World Deployment and Safety
- Advanced Topics and Future Directions

## VLA Book Series

Additionally, this repository contains a specialized series on Vision-Language-Action systems:

- Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Robot Simulation (Gazebo & Unity)
- NVIDIA Isaac AI Brain
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid

## Getting Started

To get started with this book:

1. Set up your development environment with ROS 2
2. Install required dependencies (Gazebo, Isaac Sim, etc.)
3. Work through the chapters sequentially
4. Practice with the provided code examples
5. Complete the exercises and mini-projects

Each chapter includes practical examples, code snippets, and exercises to reinforce your learning. The capstone project integrates all concepts into a complete autonomous humanoid robot system.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with robotics concepts is helpful but not required
