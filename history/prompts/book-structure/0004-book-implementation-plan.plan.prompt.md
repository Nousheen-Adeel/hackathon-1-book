# Book Implementation Plan

## Prompt Text

Create a writing and build plan for the book.
Include:
- Chapter writing order
- Tool usage (Docusaurus, GitHub Pages)
- Where code samples, diagrams, and labs appear
- Milestones for draft, review, and publish
Optimize for solo author workflow.

## Response Text

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book including writing order, Docusaurus/GitHub Pages tool usage, content structure, milestones, and solo author workflow optimization. Included supporting research and quickstart guide.

## Outcome Impact

Successfully planned the complete implementation approach for the robotics book with clear workflow, tooling, and timeline optimized for solo author.

## Tests Summary

none

## Files Summary

- specs/1-book-structure/plan.md: Complete implementation plan with architecture, workflow, and milestones
- specs/1-book-structure/research.md: Research document supporting the implementation decisions
- specs/1-book-structure/quickstart.md: Quickstart guide for setting up and working with the book project

## Next Prompts

- Create detailed tasks for book implementation
- Develop specific chapter templates
- Design review and quality assurance process

## Reflection Note

The implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for creating the robotics book with attention to both technical requirements and workflow optimization for a solo author.

## Failure Modes Observed

None
